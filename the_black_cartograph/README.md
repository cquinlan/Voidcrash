THE LATTICE:

I had this idea for some kind of partially sentient AI that lives in this latticework of exotic particles

You kind of indirectly control it and it does some bizarre form of math that actually changes the structure of the lattice and impacts the world around you

So you'd have to be able to recognize the patterns to determine if it's doing the thing you want

I figure that would be pretty cool  to do in some sort of curses style UI

Sometimes things can fuck up and you'll have to manually edit the structure
